# Karel "Bastakka" BaÅ¡ta  

ðŸ§‘ Iâ€™m a really bored student who is exploring a lot of remote topics while studying IT on high school  
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on passing school.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some real things today companies look for, because school is not teaching me them.  
âš¡ Fun fact:  I have seen and did so many things I can't do any of them well, but I can talk about a lot of them.  
              That is maybe why I blog instead of doing something productive...

## Examples of my work:  
* My repos & Their respective websites.
