# Karel "Bastakka" BaÅ¡ta  

ðŸ§‘ Iâ€™m a really bored student who is exploring a lot of remote topics while studying IT on high school  
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on passing school.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some real things today companies look for, because school is not teaching me them.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding todays IT labor.
